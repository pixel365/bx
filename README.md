# BX - Command-Line Tool for 1C-Bitrix Module Development

BX is a command-line tool for developers working on 1C-Bitrix platform modules. It allows you to declaratively define all stages of project build, as well as validate the module configuration and deploy the final distribution. Build configurations are versioned alongside the project, ensuring consistency and traceability of changes throughout the development process.
